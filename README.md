# LeetTutor

A Cloudflare Pages project that uses Groq's API to give feedback on LeetCode submissions.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Set the `GROQ_KEY` environment variable with your Groq API key (via `wrangler.toml` or the Cloudflare dashboard). When testing locally with `wrangler pages dev`, run `wrangler secret put GROQ_KEY` so the function can access the key.
3. Deploy or test with Wrangler:
   ```bash
   wrangler pages dev
   ```

### Cloudflare deployment

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, create a **Pages** project and connect it to this repository.
2. In **Settings â†’ Environment Variables**, add `GROQ_KEY` with your Groq API key.
3. Deploy normally; Pages will automatically detect the `functions/` directory and expose
   the `/api/feedback` endpoint.

## Data

`functions/questions.js` contains the problem metadata. It was generated once with `node scripts/csv-to-json.js` and normally doesn't need to be regenerated.

## API

Send a `POST` request to `/api/feedback` with JSON:

```json
{
  "question_id": "1",
  "language": "Python",
  "solution": "# your code"
}
```

The response will be `{ "feedback": "..." }`.
